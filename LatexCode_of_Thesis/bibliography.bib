The first is a straightforward application of the dyadic wavelet transform. The second is a modification of the windowed Fourier transform which tiles the time–frequency plane for a specific Q. In addition, we also demonstrate adaptive whitening by linear prediction, which greatly simplifies our statistical analysis. This is a methodology paper that aims to describe the techniques for identifying significant events as well as the necessary pre-processing that is required in order to improve their performance. For this reason we use simulated LIGO noise in order to illustrate the methods and to present their preliminary performance.}

    abstract = { The existence of gravitational radiation is a natural prediction of any relativistic description of the gravitational interaction. In this chapter, we focus on gravitational waves, as predicted by Einstein’s general theory of relativity. First, we introduce those mathematical concepts that are necessary to properly formulate the physical theory, such as the notions of manifold, vector, tensor, metric, connection and curvature. Second, we motivate, formulate and then discuss Einstein’s equation, which relates the geometry of spacetime to its matter content. Gravitational waves are later introduced as solutions of the linearized Einstein equation around flat spacetime. These waves are shown to propagate at the speed of light and to possess two polarization states. Gravitational waves can interact with matter, allowing for their direct detection by means of laser interferometers. Finally, Einstein’s quadrupole formulas are derived and used to show that nonspherical compact objects moving at relativistic speeds are powerful gravitational wave sources. }

              is a fundamental prediction of any cosmological inflationary
              model. The features of such a signal encode unique information
              about the physics of the Early Universe and beyond, thus
              representing an exciting, powerful window on the origin and
              evolution of the Universe. We review the main mechanisms of
              gravitational-wave production, ranging from quantum fluctuations
              of the gravitational field to other mechanisms that can take
              place during or after inflation. These include e.g. gravitational
              waves generated as a consequence of extra particle production
              during inflation, or during the (p)reheating phase. Gravitational
              waves produced in inflation scenarios based on modified gravity
              theories and second-order gravitational waves are also
              considered. For each analyzed case, the expected power spectrum
              is given. We discuss the discriminating power among different
              models, associated with the validity/violation of the standard
              consistency relation between tensor-to-scalar ratio r and tensor
              spectral index nT In light of the prospects for
              (directly/indirectly) detecting primordial gravitational waves,
